Sure! Below is a Python example of a "Smart Delivery" application. This program focuses on last-mile delivery logistics using AI-driven route planning and inventory management. It includes commenting and error handling for clarity and robustness. Note that this is a simplified version to demonstrate the concept and might not cover all complexities you might encounter in a full-fledged application.

```python
import numpy as np
import random

# Define a mock-up of geographical locations (latitude, longitude) for delivery points
DELIVERY_LOCATIONS = [(40.7128, -74.0060), (34.0522, -118.2437), (41.8781, -87.6298), (29.7604, -95.3698)]

class RoutePlanner:
    def __init__(self, locations):
        self.locations = locations

    def calculate_distance(self, loc1, loc2):
        # Calculate Euclidean distance for simplicity
        dist = np.sqrt((loc1[0] - loc2[0])**2 + (loc1[1] - loc2[1])**2)
        return dist

    def find_optimal_route(self, start_location):
        try:
            # A naive way to plan a route is to always deliver to the nearest location
            remaining_locations = self.locations[:]
            current_location = start_location
            route = [start_location]

            while remaining_locations:
                next_location = min(remaining_locations, key=lambda loc: self.calculate_distance(current_location, loc))
                route.append(next_location)
                current_location = next_location
                remaining_locations.remove(next_location)

            return route
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error optimizing route: {e}")
            return []

class InventoryManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.inventory = {}

    def update_inventory(self, item, quantity):
        if item in self.inventory:
            self.inventory[item] += quantity
        else:
            self.inventory[item] = quantity

    def get_inventory_status(self):
        return self.inventory

    def check_inventory(self, item, required_quantity):
        """ Check if the required quantity of an item is available """
        return self.inventory.get(item, 0) >= required_quantity

def simulate_deliveries():
    print("Simulating Smart Delivery System...")
    
    # Initialize the RoutePlanner with potential delivery locations
    planner = RoutePlanner(DELIVERY_LOCATIONS)
    start_location = (37.7749, -122.4194)  # Starting from a hub (San Francisco, for example)

    # Error handling and debugging message
    try:
        route = planner.find_optimal_route(start_location)
        print("Optimal route found:")
        for loc in route:
            print(f"Delivery to location: {loc}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to find the route: {e}")
    
    # Initialize the Inventory Manager
    inventory = InventoryManager()

    # Update inventory with some mock data
    inventory.update_inventory("item_1", 100)
    inventory.update_inventory("item_2", 75)

    # Check inventory before a delivery
    try:
        required_item = "item_1"
        required_quantity = 20
        if inventory.check_inventory(required_item, required_quantity):
            print(f"{required_quantity} of {required_item} is available for delivery.")
        else:
            print(f"Insufficient {required_item} in inventory.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error checking inventory: {e}")
    
    print("Current Inventory Status:")
    status = inventory.get_inventory_status()
    for item, qty in status.items():
        print(f"{item}: {qty} units")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_deliveries()
```

### Key Features

- **Route Planning**: The `RoutePlanner` class is designed to find an optimal delivery route based on Euclidean distances between locations. You could replace this with more sophisticated algorithms or integrate ML models.
  
- **Inventory Management**: The `InventoryManager` class maintains and checks inventory levels, ensuring required items are available for delivery.

- **Error Handling**: Exception blocks handle unexpected errors, preventing application crashes and providing useful error messages.

- **Comments**: Detailed comments are added for clarity and understanding about what each component of the code is doing.

This code provides a foundation for exploring more complex AI-driven logistics solutions.
